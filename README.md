# csnode-rs
The project implements the node in Rust lang to be compatible with credits.com node (https://github.com/CREDITSCOM/node).
Original node is based on p2p (https://github.com/SychevS/p2p) repo as complete network subsystem. Original node implemented in C++ lang as well as p2p.
So the csnode-rs is based on csp2p-rs crate (https://github.com/0xAAE/csnode-rs) which adopts p2p submodule to Rust.

It is now the very beginning of development...
