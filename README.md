# csnode-rs
The project implements the node in Rust lang to be compatible with <b>credits.com node</b> (https://github.com/CREDITSCOM/node).
<p>Original node is based on <b>p2p</b> (https://github.com/SychevS/p2p) repo as complete network subsystem. Original node is implemented in C++ lang as well as <b>p2p</b>.
<p>So, the <b>csnode-rs</b> is based on my own <b>csp2p-rs</b> crate (https://github.com/0xAAE/csp2p-rs) which adopts <b>p2p</b> submodule to Rust.
<br/><br/>
<p>It is now the very beginning of development...
